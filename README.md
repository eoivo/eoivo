## 🚀 Who I Am

Full-Stack Developer shipping **production systems that scale and generate revenue**.

From publishing SDKs on NPM to architecting multi-tenant SaaS platforms with billing engines and AI-powered churn prediction — I build at the intersection of scalable architecture, business-critical systems, and AI integration.

Most of my work is in proprietary enterprise products (multi-tenancy, webhook orchestration, async processing with Bull/Redis, biometric SDKs, ML pipelines). The technical challenges are real.

> 💼 **Check my [Portfolio](https://ivo-fernandes.netlify.app/)** for a comprehensive view of what I've built. Most substantial projects are private due to commercial/contractual reasons.
